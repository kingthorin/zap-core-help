<H1>Release 2.17.0</H1>

This is a bug fix and enhancement release.

TBC

<H3>Alert De-duplication</H3>
Changes have been made in order to reduce the number of alerts which ZAP may raise that are duplicaes or highly similar, more closely being aligned with the Sites Tree representation.
See the <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/blog/2025-09-30-alert-de-duplication/">Alert De-duplication blog</a> for further details.

<H3>Systemic Alerts</H3>
TBC

<H3>Structured Reports ISO 8601 Standard Date</H3>
The structured reports (JSON and XML) now have an ISO 8601 standard date field/attribute (“created”); 
the existing “generatedString” field will be removed in the future.

<H3>Active Scan Temporary HTTP Messages</H3>
If this option is selected the active scanner will persist all HTTP messages sent while active scanning, which allows to further inspect them (e.g. custom passive scanners, manually).
They are temporary and removed once the session is closed, for cases where the HTTP messages are not necessary it is advised to disable this option for performance reasons (I/O, disk space).
<p>
By default the HTTP messages are persisted unless in command line mode, where sessions are usually discarded once ZAP finishes.

<H3>Dependency Updates</H3>
