<h1>サイトタブ</h1>
The sites tab contains two trees, one for <a href="../../start/features/contexts.html">Contexts</a> and the other for the <a href="../../start/features/sitestree.html">Sites Tree</a>.

<h2>Contexts tree</h2>
Shows the contexts contained in the current session. It allows to quickly access its properties by double clicking them and
provides access to other functionality through the component's context menu.

<h3>Right click menu</h3>
Right clicking on a context will bring up a menu which will allow you to:

<h4>動的スキャン…</h4>
This will launch the <a href="../dialogs/advascan.html">Active Scan dialog</a> which allows you to initiate an 
<a href="../../start/features/ascan.html">active scan</a> with the starting point set to the context you selected.<br/>

<h4>スパイダー...</h4>
This will launch the Spider dialog which allows you to initiate the 
spider with the starting point set to the context you selected.<br/>

<h4>Add to Scope/Remove from Scope</h4>

<h4><img src="../../images/fugue/application-blue-export.png" />Export Context...</h4>
Allows to export the selected context.

<h4>Export URLs for Context</h4>
Allows to export the URLs of the selected context.

<h2>Sites tree</h2>
Shows all of the URLs visited in a tree structure. <br/>
You can select any of the nodes in the tree to display the request and response for that URL 
in the relevant tabs.<br/>

<h3>Right click menu</h3>
Right clicking on a node will bring up a menu which will allow you to:

<h4>Attack</h4>
The Attack menu has the following submenus:

<h5>Active Scan...</h5>
This will launch the <a href="../dialogs/advascan.html">Active Scan</a> dialog which allows you to initiate an 
<a href="../../start/features/ascan.html">active scan</a> with the starting point set to the request you selected.<br/>

<h5>Spider...</h5>
This will launch the Spider dialog which allows you to initiate the 
spider with the starting point set to the request you selected.<br/>

<h4>Include in Context</h4>
This menu allows you to include the selected nodes and all of their subordinates in the specified
<a href="../../start/features/contexts.html">context</a>.<br/>
You also have the option to create a new context.<br/>
The <a href="../dialogs/session/contexts.html">Session Contexts</a> dialog will be displayed to
allow you to make any additional changes.

<h4>Exclude from Context</h4>
This menu allows you to exclude the selected nodes and all of their subordinates from the specified
<a href="../../start/features/contexts.html">context</a>.<br/>
The <a href="../dialogs/session/contexts.html">Session Contexts</a> dialog will be displayed to
allow you to make any additional changes.

<h4>Flag as context</h4>
This menu has the following submenus for each of the 
<a href="../../start/features/contexts.html">contexts</a> you have defined:

<h5><i>Context name</i> Form-based Auth Login request</h5>
This identifies the specified node as a login request for the specified context.<br/>
You may only have one node identified as such in any one context.<br/> 
The <a href="../dialogs/session/context-auth.html">Session Context Authentication</a> screen will be displayed to
allow you to make any additional changes.

<h4><i>Context name</i> JSON-based Auth Login request</h4>
This identifies the specified node as a login request for the specified context.<br/>
You may only have one node identified as such in any one context.<br/> 
The <a href="../dialogs/session/context-auth.html">Session Context Authentication</a> screen will be displayed to
allow you to make any additional changes.

<h5><i>Context name</i> Data driven node</h5>
This identifies the specified node as <a href="../../start/features/ddc.html">Data driven content</a> for the specified context.<br/>
The <a href="../dialogs/session/context-struct.html">Session Context Structure</a> screen will be displayed to
allow you to make any additional changes.

<h4>Exclude from</h4>
This menu has the following submenus:

<h5>Proxy</h5>
This will exclude the selected nodes from the proxy. They will still be proxied via ZAP but will not be shown 
in any of the tabs.<br/>
This can be used to ignore URLs that you know are not relevant to the system you are currently testing.<br/>
The nodes can be included again via the <a href="../dialogs/session/sessprop.html">Session Properties</a> dialog   

<h5>Scanner</h5>
This will prevent the selected nodes from being actively scanned.<br/>
The nodes can be included again via the <a href="../dialogs/session/sessprop.html">Session Properties</a> dialog   

<h5>Spider</h5>
This will prevent the selected nodes from being spidered.<br/>
The nodes can be included again via the <a href="../dialogs/session/sessprop.html">Session Properties</a> dialog   

<h4>Delete</h4>
This will remove the node and all of its children from ZAP.<br/>
However they can be added back in, to prevent this use the 'Exclude from' menus. 

<h4>Break...</h4>
This will bring up a new window which will allow you to set a 
<a href="../../start/features/breakpoints.html">breakpoint</a> on that URL.<br/>
The breakpoint is defined via a regular expression. If you visit a URL which matches this 
expression then ZAP will intercept it and allow you to change either the request or the
response.

<h4>Alerts for this node</h4>
If the URL selected has <a href="../../start/features/alerts.html">alerts</a> associated with it then 
they will be listed under this menu.<br>
Selecting one of the alerts will cause it to be displayed.

<h4>New Alert...</h4>
This will bring up the
<a href="../dialogs/addalert.html">Add Alert dialog</a> which allows you to manually record a new  
<a href="../../start/features/alerts.html">alert</a> against this request.

<h4>Show in History tab</h4>
This will show the selected node in the <a href="history.html">History tab</a>.

<h4>Open URL in Browser</h4>
This will open the URL of the selected node in your default browser.

<h4>Generate anti CSRF test form</h4>
This will open a URL which will give you a generated form for testing for CSRF issues.<br>
It will only be enabled for POST requests, if the API is enabled and if Java supports the opening of URLs 
in a browser on your platform. 

<h4>Refresh Sites tree</h4>
Occasionally the Sites tree can be displayed incorrectly - this option will redraw it.
