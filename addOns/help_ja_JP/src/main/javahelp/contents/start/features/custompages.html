	<h1>Custom Page</h1>
	ZAP can accommodate the definition of various non-standard error handling conditions.<br>
	Each <a href="contexts.html">Context</a> may include multiple Custom Page definitions, with the following elements:
	<ul>
	<li>Enabled > Whether the definition is enabled or not.</li>
	<li>Content > The String or Regex which defines the URL or response content to be matched.</li>
	<li>Content Location > Whether the "Content" should be matched against a URL or response "Content".</li>
	<li>Is Regex? > Indicating whether or not "Content" is a regular expression or not.</li>
	<li>Custom Page Type > Specifying what type of Custom Page is being defined:
		<ul>
		<li>Error Page > For '500 - Internal Server Error' type pages.</li>
		<li>Not Found > For '404 - Not Found' responses.</li>
		<li>Ok > For '200 - Ok' definitions</li>
		<li>Other > To facilitate use of Custom Pages in scripts or other usages that have not yet been foreseen.</li>
		<li>Auth. Issue > For Authentication/Authorization related responses. For example: '401 - Unauthorized' or '403 - Forbidden' type conditions.</li>
		</ul> 
	</ul>

	<h2>Configuration example</h2>
	<p>A configuration example showing how to fully configure a webapp that returns a 200 - Ok response with the message 
	"Sorry, we can't seem to find what you were looking for" is seen below:
	<ol>
		<li>Set up a context for the web application</li>
		<li>Make sure your browser proxies everything through ZAP and browse to a page or endpoint which doesn't exist</li>
		<li>Go to ZAP and identify the request</li>
		<li>Set up the Custom Page definition:
			<ol>
			<li>Highlight "Sorry, we can't seem to find what you were looking for" in the response pane, Right click and 'Flag as Context... Custom Page Indicator'</li>
			<li>A dialog will be opened already containing the highlighted response string.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Accept the addition of the Custom Page definition.</li>
	</ol>
